#### 2. What is buffer overflow? Discuss the types of buffer overflow. [5]

**Buffer Overflow:**

- *Definition:* Buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a block of memory, or buffer, than it was allocated, leading to memory corruption.

**Types of Buffer Overflow:**

1. **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:**

   - Overflows the program's call stack, modifying the return address to redirect execution.
2. **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**

   - Targets the dynamically allocated memory in the heap, causing unpredictable behavior.
3. **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP):**

   - Exploits existing code fragments, known as "gadgets," to execute malicious actions.

#### 3. Define Cyberstalking. How does stalking work? [2+2]

**Cyberstalking:**

- *Definition:* Cyberstalking involves the persistent use of electronic communications to harass or intimidate an individual, causing fear or emotional distress.

**How Stalking Works:**

- **Online Harassment:** Sending threatening emails, messages, or posts.
- **Spyware:** Installing spyware to monitor the victim's online activities.
- **Impersonation:** Creating fake profiles to harass or deceive the victim.
- **Doxxing:** Revealing private information online to harm the victim.

#### 4. Explain the difference between passive and active attacks. [4]

**Passive Attacks:**

- *Nature:* Involves monitoring and eavesdropping.
- *Objective:* Gather information without altering data.
- *Examples:* Traffic analysis, interception of data.

**Active Attacks:**

- *Nature:* Involves modification or disruption of data.
- *Objective:* Alter, destroy, or interfere with data.
- *Examples:* Injection attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks.

#### 5. What are DoS and DDoS attacks? What are the steps to protect against DoS/DDoS attacks? [2+5]

**DoS (Denial of Service) Attack:**

- Overloads a system, service, or network to make it unavailable to users.

**DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack:**

- Utilizes multiple compromised systems to flood a target with traffic, overwhelming its resources.

**Steps to Protect Against DoS/DDoS Attacks:**

1. **Traffic Filtering:** Use firewalls and intrusion prevention systems to filter malicious traffic.
2. **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.
3. **Incident Response Plan:** Develop a plan to quickly respond to and mitigate attacks.
4. **Bandwidth Management:** Implement bandwidth throttling to control traffic flow.
5. **Anomaly Detection:** Use tools to detect abnormal patterns and behavior indicative of an attack.

#### 6. Discuss the role of Cloud computing in cybersecurity. [5]

**Role of Cloud Computing in Cybersecurity:**

- **Centralized Security:** Cloud providers offer centralized security measures, reducing the burden on individual users or organizations.
- **Scalability:** Cloud platforms can scale resources to meet security demands effectively.
- **Automated Security Updates:** Cloud providers often handle security updates automatically, ensuring systems are protected against known vulnerabilities.
- **Data Encryption:** Cloud services typically include encryption to protect data during storage and transmission.
- **Access Controls:** Cloud providers implement robust access controls to restrict unauthorized access to data.
