### **21. Vector Space Model of Information Retrieval**

The Vector Space Model (VSM) is a mathematical framework used for information retrieval. In this model, documents and queries are represented as vectors in a multidimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a unique term. The presence or absence of terms in documents or queries is expressed by the elements of the vectors. Here are the key points:

- **Representation as Vectors:** Each document and query is represented as a vector in the vector space, with terms as dimensions. If a term is present in a document or query, the corresponding dimension gets a non-zero value.
- **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** To account for the importance of terms, TF-IDF weighting is often applied. It considers both the frequency of a term in a document (TF) and its rarity across all documents (IDF). The TF-IDF score is calculated for each term in the vectors.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Similarity between a query vector and document vectors is measured using the cosine of the angle between them. Higher cosine values indicate greater similarity.
- **Document Ranking:** Documents are ranked based on their cosine similarity with the query. The top-ranked documents are considered more relevant to the query.

### **22. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fundamental Concepts, Sentiment Analysis, and Challenges**

a) **Fundamental Concepts in NLP:**

- **Tokenization:** Breaking text into tokens (words, phrases, etc.).
- **Lemmatization and Stemming:** Reducing words to their base or root form.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Assigning grammatical categories to words.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying entities (e.g., names, locations) in text.
- **Syntax and Semantics:** Understanding sentence structure and meaning.

b) **Application to Sentiment Analysis in Social Media Posts:**

- **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, removing stop words, and handling emojis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Using techniques like TF-IDF to represent text.
- **Sentiment Classification:** Applying machine learning models to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Contextual Analysis:** Considering the context of social media language, including slang and informal expressions.

c) **Challenges in NLP:**

- **Ambiguity:** Words and phrases with multiple meanings.
- **Data Variability:** Diverse language use across different domains and contexts.
- **Lack of Annotated Data:** Limited labeled data for training robust models.
- **Domain Specificity:** NLP models may not generalize well across different domains.

### **23. Disjunction, Grouping, and Precedence in Regular Expression**

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching. Disjunction, grouping, and precedence are essential concepts in regex:

- **Disjunction (`|`):** Represents logical OR. For example, `(cat|dog)` matches either "cat" or "dog."
- **Grouping (`()`):** Groups elements together, affecting the scope of operations. For example, `(ab)+` matches one or more occurrences of "ab."
- **Precedence (`()`):** Defines the order of operations. For example, `a(b|c)+` matches one or more occurrences of "ab" or "ac."

These constructs enhance the expressiveness and flexibility of regular expressions, allowing for more complex and precise pattern matching. They provide a way to specify alternatives, control repetition, and establish the hierarchy of operations within a regex pattern.

### **24. Greediness in Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions**

In regular expressions, the term "greedy" refers to a matching behavior where the pattern tries to match as much as possible while still allowing the overall match to succeed. The greediness of a regex quantifier determines whether it consumes the maximum or minimum possible characters.

Justification:

- **Greedy Quantifiers:** Symbols like `*` and `+` are greedy by default. For example, in the regex `a.*b`, if the input is `afooabbarb`, the greedy `.*` matches the longest possible substring `fooabbar`.
- **Non-Greedy (Lazy) Quantifiers:** Adding `?` after a quantifier makes it non-greedy, matching the shortest possible substring while still allowing the overall match to succeed. In the regex `a.*?b`, the non-greedy `.*?` matches the shortest substring `foo` in the input `afooabbarb`.

### **25. Regular Expression to Find Instances of 'the'**

A regular expression to find all instances of the word 'the' in a text would be: `\bthe\b`.

- `\b`: Word boundary ensures that 'the' is a whole word and not part of another word.
- `the`: The literal string 'the'.

This regex will match all occurrences of 'the' as standalone words.

### **26. Steps for Building the NLP Pipeline**

Building an NLP pipeline involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant text data from various sources.
2. **Text Cleaning:** Preprocess the text by removing noise, such as HTML tags, special characters, and irrelevant symbols.
3. **Tokenization:** Break the text into individual words or tokens.
4. **Stopword Removal:** Eliminate common words (stopwords) that do not contribute much to the meaning.
5. **Stemming or Lemmatization:** Reduce words to their root form to handle variations.
6. **Feature Extraction:** Convert text into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
7. **Model Building:** Choose and train NLP models based on the specific task (e.g., sentiment analysis, named entity recognition).
8. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
9. **Deployment:** Implement the NLP solution in a real-world environment.

Each step contributes to creating an effective NLP pipeline for processing and understanding textual data.

### **27. Lemmatization Process**

Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or root form, known as the lemma. It involves removing inflections and variations to get the canonical or dictionary form of a word. The process is more sophisticated than stemming, as it considers the context and meaning of words.

Steps in Lemmatization:

1. **Tokenization:** Break the text into individual words or tokens.
2. **POS Tagging:** Assign part-of-speech tags to each word in the context.
3. **Lemmatization:** Apply lemmatization rules based on the word's part of speech to obtain the lemma.

   - For nouns, lemmatization involves removing plurals and reducing the word to its singular form.
   - For verbs, lemmatization involves removing verb conjugations to obtain the base form.
   - For adjectives and adverbs, lemmatization ensures the word is in its standard form.
4. **Output:** The output is a set of words represented by their lemmas.

Example:

- Original: "Running"
- Lemma: "Run"

### **28. Operations of Editing One String to Another**

Editing operations transform one string into another and are commonly used in algorithms like Levenshtein distance. The main editing operations are:

- **Insertion:** Adding a character to one string to make it match the other.
- **Deletion:** Removing a character from one string to align it with the other.
- **Substitution:** Replacing a character in one string with another.
- **Transposition:** Swapping adjacent characters to correct the order.

These operations are used in algorithms to calculate the minimum number of edits needed to transform one string into another.

### **29. Calculate Edit Distance from "leda" to "deal"**

Using 1-insertion, 1-deletion, and 2-substitution costs:

- `leda` → `le_a` (1 substitution)
- `le_a` → `dea` (1 substitution)
- `dea` → `deal` (1 insertion)

Total Edit Distance: 3
