- **Purpose:**

  - POS tagging aids in syntactic and semantic analysis by indicating the role and function of each word within a sentence.
- **Example:**

  - In the sentence "The cat is sleeping," POS tagging would identify "The" as a determiner (DT), "cat" as a noun (NN), "is" as a verb (VB), and "sleeping" as a verb (VBG).

ii) **Comparison of Open Class & Closed Class Word Groups (4 points):**

- **Open Class Words:**

  - Open class words are lexically rich and accept new additions. They include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
  - Example: "Technology" (noun), "Innovate" (verb), "Brilliant" (adjective), "Quickly" (adverb).
- **Closed Class Words:**

  - Closed class words have a stable set and rarely accept new additions. They include pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and determiners.
  - Example: "He" (pronoun), "Under" (preposition), "And" (conjunction), "The" (determiner).

iii) **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (3 points):**

### **17. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Viterbi Algorithm**

**(i) Brief Description of Hidden Markov Model (HMM):**

- A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model widely used in various fields, including natural language processing, speech recognition, bioinformatics, and finance. It is a type of probabilistic graphical model that represents a system with hidden states, observable emissions, and transitions between states. HMMs are particularly useful for modeling sequential data and capturing dependencies between successive observations.

### Key Components of an HMM:

1. **States (Hidden and Observable):**

   - **Hidden States (X):** These represent the underlying, unobservable system states. HMM assumes that these states cannot be directly observed.
   - **Observable States (Y):** These are the states that emit observable symbols or observations. In the context of language modeling, observable states might represent words in a sentence.
2. **Transitions:**

   - HMM models the transitions between hidden states. The probability of transitioning from one hidden state to another is governed by transition probabilities.
3. **Emissions:**

   - Each hidden state emits observable symbols with associated probabilities. These emission probabilities define the likelihood of observing a particular symbol when the system is in a specific hidden state.
4. **Initial State Probabilities:**

   - The probability distribution of starting in a particular hidden state.

### HMM Usage in Natural Language Processing (NLP):

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** HMMs can be used to model the sequence of part-of-speech tags in a sentence.
- **Speech Recognition:** HMMs are employed to model phonemes and acoustic features in speech signals.
- **Named Entity Recognition:** HMMs can be used to model sequences of words and their corresponding named entity labels.
- **Machine Translation:** HMMs can model the alignment between words in source and target languages.

### Example:

Consider a simple HMM for part-of-speech tagging. The hidden states (X) might represent different parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb), and the observable states (Y) are the actual words in a sentence. The transitions between hidden states and emission probabilities for each observable state are learned from training data.

**(ii) Working of the Viterbi Algorithm in HMM Context:**

- **Objective:**

  - The Viterbi algorithm is employed to find the most likely sequence of hidden states (state path) that explains the observed sequence of emissions.
- **Steps:**

  1. **Initialization:**
     - Initialize a matrix to store the probabilities of the most likely path ending in each state after observing each emission.
  2. **Recursion:**
     - Iterate over each observation, updating the probabilities based on the transitions and emission probabilities. Maintain a traceback to remember the most likely path.
  3. **Termination:**
     - After processing all observations, identify the state with the highest probability in the last column as the endpoint.
  4. **Backtrack:**
     - Backtrack through the traceback to reconstruct the most likely state sequence.
- **Significance:**

  - The Viterbi algorithm efficiently computes the most probable sequence of hidden states, crucial for tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and decoding in speech recognition.
- **Example:**

  - In speech recognition, given observed acoustic features (emissions), the Viterbi algorithm helps determine the sequence of phonemes (hidden states) that best explains the observed speech.

### **19. Application of HMM in Parts-of-Speech Tagging**

- Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are extensively used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in the task of Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging. Here's how HMMs are applied in POS tagging:

### Application of HMM in POS Tagging:

1. **Model Representation:**

   - **States:** HMMs represent words in a sequence as a series of states.
   - **Observations:** Each word corresponds to an observation emitted from these states.
   - **Transition Probabilities:** HMMs employ transition probabilities between states representing the likelihood of moving from one POS tag to another.
   - **Emission Probabilities:** The emission probabilities signify the probability of a specific word being associated with a particular POS tag.
2. **POS Tagging:**

   - **Training Phase:** Initially, the HMM model is trained using a labeled dataset where words are tagged with their corresponding POS tags.
   - **Transition and Emission Probabilities:** Based on this training data, the model learns transition probabilities between POS tags and emission probabilities for each word given a particular tag.
3. **Decoding and Tagging:**

   - **Decoding Algorithm (Viterbi):** During the decoding phase, the Viterbi algorithm is often used with HMMs to determine the most likely sequence of POS tags for a given input sentence.
   - **Tag Assignment:** By calculating probabilities of different tag sequences and choosing the sequence with the highest probability, HMMs assign POS tags to each word in the input sequence.
4. **Example:**

   - Given a sentence "He runs quickly," the HMM-based POS tagger would use transition probabilities to identify that "He" is likely a pronoun, "runs" is a verb, and "quickly" is an adverb.

### Advantages of HMMs in POS Tagging:

- **Statistical Modeling:** HMMs can capture statistical dependencies between words and their POS tags based on the training data.
- **Contextual Information:** They consider the context of neighboring words while assigning POS tags, enhancing accuracy.
- **Efficiency:** HMMs enable relatively efficient tagging by utilizing probabilistic models.
- **Robustness:** They handle unseen words by generalizing based on similar observed contexts during training.
- **Widely Adopted:** HMM-based POS tagging is a well-established technique in NLP and has been used successfully in various applications.

By leveraging the structure of HMMs and their ability to model sequences of observations, POS tagging benefits from the inherent capabilities of these models to assign probable POS tags to words within a given context.

### **20. Viterbi Algorithm in the Context of HMMs**

- The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) given a sequence of observations. In the context of HMMs, the Viterbi algorithm plays a crucial role in decoding and determining the most probable sequence of states that generated a particular sequence of observations.

### Working of the Viterbi Algorithm in HMMs:

1. **Initialization:**

   - The algorithm begins by initializing a table, often referred to as the Viterbi table, to store intermediate results.
   - Each cell in the table corresponds to a particular state at a specific time step.
2. **Initialization Step (t = 1):**

   - For the first time step (t = 1), the algorithm calculates the probability of transitioning from an initial state to each possible state and multiplying it by the probability of emitting the first observation from that state.
   - The maximum probability for each state is stored in the corresponding cell of the Viterbi table.
3. **Recursion Step (t > 1):**

   - For subsequent time steps (t > 1), the algorithm iterates through each state and computes the maximum probability of reaching that state at the current time step.
   - It considers the probabilities of transitioning from the previous states to the current state, multiplied by the probability of emitting the current observation from the current state.
   - The maximum probability for each state is calculated and stored in the Viterbi table.
4. **Termination:**

   - Once the algorithm processes all time steps, the final step involves selecting the state with the highest probability in the last time step. This state represents the most likely ending state of the sequence.
5. **Backtracking:**

   - After determining the most probable path through the states, the algorithm backtracks through the Viterbi table to reconstruct the sequence of states that led to the maximum probability.

### Example:

Consider an HMM for POS tagging where states represent POS tags, observations are words, and transitions/emissions have associated probabilities. The Viterbi algorithm would find the most likely sequence of POS tags for a given sentence.

### Advantages of the Viterbi Algorithm in HMMs:

- **Efficiency:** The Viterbi algorithm efficiently computes the most likely state sequence without exploring all possible combinations.
- **Dynamic Programming:** It exploits the principle of optimal substructure, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.
- **Probabilistic Inference:** By considering transition and emission probabilities, the algorithm provides a probabilistic interpretation of the most likely state sequence.
- **Widely Applicable:** The Viterbi algorithm is used not only in POS tagging but also in various applications involving sequential data and HMMs.

In summary, the Viterbi algorithm is a fundamental tool in decoding HMMs, providing a systematic and efficient way to identify the most likely hidden state sequence given observed data.
