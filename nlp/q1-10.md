### 1. Discuss in detail the steps of Natural Language Processing. Discuss with examples the various levels of ambiguity in Natural Language. (10 points)

### **Natural Language Processing Steps:**

#### 1. Lexical Analysis:

- **Definition:** Lexical analysis involves deciphering and segmenting language into meaningful units, such as paragraphs, sentences, phrases, and words.
- **Process:**
  - Identifying lexemes: The text is broken down into lexemes, which are the basic units of meaning.
  - Categorizing into parts of speech (POS): Words are classified based on their grammatical functions.
  - Identifying morphemes: Lexemes are further divided into morphemes, the smallest units of meaning.
- **Example:** Analyzing the sentence "the understandable vocabulary that makes up a language" involves identifying lexemes like "vocabulary" and "language," categorizing them as nouns, and breaking them into morphemes like "understand-" and "-able."

#### 2. Syntactic Analysis:

- **Definition:** Syntactic analysis examines how words and phrases arrange to form grammatically correct sentences.
- **Process:**
  - Checking grammar: Evaluating the arrangement of words for proper syntax.
- **Example:** The sentence "Dave wrote the paper" passes syntactic analysis, while "Dave do jumps" is deemed syntactically incorrect.

#### 3. Semantic Analysis:

- **Definition:** Semantic analysis aims to understand the literal meaning of individual language selections, focusing on the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences.
- **Process:**
  - Understanding meaning: Assessing the actual meaning of language selections.
- **Example:** "Manhattan calls out to Dave" might pass syntactic analysis but fails semantic analysis because it doesn't make literal sense for a place to call out to someone.

#### 5. Pragmatic Analysis:

- **Definition:** Pragmatic analysis focuses on interpreting the intended meaning rather than the literal meaning of language.
- **Process:**
  - Deriving intended meaning: Assessing the context to understand the speaker's intended meaning.
- **Example:** Understanding that "Manhattan speaks to all its people" is likely a metaphorical expression rather than a literal statement.

#### 4. Discourse Integration:

- **Definition:** Discourse integration involves analyzing prior words and sentences to understand the meaning of ambiguous language.
- **Process:**
  - Contextual analysis: Understanding the context by considering preceding words and sentences.
- **Example:** If one sentence mentions "Manhattan speaks to all its people," discourse integration helps understand that "It" in the following sentence refers to Manhattan.

### **Levels of Ambiguity:**

- **Lexical Ambiguity:** Words with multiple meanings. Example: "Bank" (financial institution or river bank).
- **Syntactic Ambiguity:** Ambiguity in sentence structure. Example: "I saw the man with the telescope" (Did I use the telescope or did the man have it?).
- **Semantic Ambiguity:** Ambiguity in the meaning of words or phrases. Example: "She saw the man on the hill with the telescope" (Who has the telescope?).
- **Pragmatic Ambiguity:** Ambiguity in the implied meaning due to context. Example: "Can you pass me the salt?" (Could mean passing the salt physically or verbally).

### 2. Explain the algorithm to edit one string X of length n to a string Y of length m. Show the steps of your algorithm for X=INTENTION and Y=EXECUTION (10 points)

**Algorithm: Edit Distance (Dynamic Programming)**

1. **Initialization:** Create an (n+1) x (m+1) matrix.
2. **Base Cases:** Fill in the first row and column with values 0 to n and 0 to m respectively.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Fill in the matrix using recurrence relation:
   - If X[i] equals Y[j], then D[i][j] = D[i-1][j-1].
   - Otherwise, D[i][j] = min(D[i-1][j], D[i][j-1], D[i-1][j-1]) + 1.
4. **Backtracking:** Trace the matrix back to find the operations that lead to the minimum edit distance.


### 3. (i) What is bag of Words? (2 points) (ii) What is TF-IDF? Mention its application (3 points)

**i) Bag of Words (BoW):**

- **Definition:** BoW is a representation of text that ignores the order and structure but considers the frequency of words.
- **Example:** For the sentence "The cat in the hat," the BoW representation would be: {The: 2, cat: 1, in: 1, the: 1, hat: 1}.

**ii) TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**

- **Definition:** TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).
- **Formula:** TF-IDF = TF (Term Frequency) * IDF (Inverse Document Frequency).
- **Application:** It is widely used in information retrieval and text mining tasks. For example, in document classification, TF-IDF helps in identifying the importance of words in distinguishing one category from another.

This helps to weigh down the impact of common words and highlight words that are distinct to a particular document.
