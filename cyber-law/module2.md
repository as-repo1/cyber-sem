### Module 2: Cybercrime Mobile & Wireless Devices

#### 1. What is Cyber Crime? What is the role of Cyber Café in cyber crime? [5]

**Cyber Crime:**
Cybercrime refers to criminal activities carried out through the use of computers, networks, and the internet. It includes various illegal actions, such as hacking, identity theft, online fraud, and the dissemination of malware.

**Role of Cyber Café in Cyber Crime:**

- *Anonymity:* Cyber cafés provide a level of anonymity, making it challenging to trace individuals involved in cybercrime.
- *Unmonitored Access:* Users in cyber cafés may engage in illegal activities without supervision, facilitating cybercrime.
- *Unsecured Computers:* Cyber cafés may not have robust security measures, making their computer systems vulnerable to malware and cyber attacks.
- *Shared Resources:* Multiple users on the same computer may inadvertently expose sensitive information, contributing to cyber threats.

#### 2. Discuss how ‘perception’ makes people least suspect cyber security threats through mobile handheld devices. What measures do you recommend against this situation? [2+5]

**Perception and Mobile Security:**
People often perceive mobile devices as less susceptible to cyber threats, assuming that traditional security concerns do not apply to them. This perception stems from the misconception that mobile devices are inherently secure.

**Measures to Counteract Perception:**

1. **Education and Awareness:** Conduct awareness campaigns to educate users about the real security risks associated with mobile devices.
2. **Regular Updates:** Emphasize the importance of keeping mobile operating systems, apps, and antivirus software up to date to address vulnerabilities.
3. **Secure Wi-Fi Practices:** Educate users about the risks of connecting to unsecured Wi-Fi networks and encourage the use of virtual private networks (VPNs).
4. **App Permissions:** Encourage users to review and understand app permissions before installation to limit potential security risks.
5. **Strong Authentication:** Promote the use of strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication for added security.

#### 3. What kind of attacks are possible on mobile/cell phones? Explain with examples. [4]

**Types of Mobile Phone Attacks:**

1. **Malware Attacks:**

   - *Example:* Mobile malware can include viruses, trojans, and ransomware that compromise the device's security and data.
2. **Phishing Attacks:**

   - *Example:* SMS or email phishing messages trick users into clicking on malicious links, leading to unauthorized access.
3. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**

   - *Example:* Intercepting communication between the device and a server, allowing attackers to eavesdrop or manipulate data.
4. **Bluetooth Hacking:**

   - *Example:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in Bluetooth connections to gain unauthorized access to devices for data theft.

#### 4. ‘Bring Your Own Device’ movement causes security issues in the workplace – write your views on allowing personal laptops in the workplace. [6]

**BYOD and Workplace Security:**

- **Advantages:**

  - Increased Employee Satisfaction.
  - Cost Savings for Employers.
  - Enhanced Productivity and Flexibility.
- **Disadvantages:**

  - Security Risks Due to Diverse Device Types.
  - Data Privacy and Confidentiality Concerns.
  - Difficulty in Implementing Uniform Security Policies.

**Views on Allowing Personal Laptops:**
Balancing the advantages and disadvantages is crucial. Implementing robust security measures, including encryption, strong authentication, and regularly updated security software, can mitigate risks. Additionally, clear BYOD policies outlining security expectations and consequences for non-compliance are essential.

#### 5. Write the full form of IMEI. Mention the method of getting the IMEI number and the role of IMEI number in tracing your lost/stolen mobile phone. [1+4]

**IMEI:**

- *Full Form:* International Mobile Equipment Identity.

**Getting IMEI Number:**

- Dialing *#06# on the mobile phone.
- Finding it in the device settings.

**Role in Tracing Lost/Stolen Phones:**

- **Identification:** IMEI uniquely identifies each mobile device.
- **Tracking:** Mobile carriers and law enforcement agencies use IMEI to track and locate lost or stolen phones.
- **Blocking:** Mobile operators can block a device with a reported IMEI, rendering it unusable and discouraging theft.

#### 6. What is a Trojan Horse? How can your laptop be protected from it? [5]

**Trojan Horse:**
A Trojan Horse is malicious software disguised as legitimate or benign software. Once installed, it can perform various harmful actions, such as stealing data, providing unauthorized access, or damaging the system.

**Protection from Trojan Horses:**

1. **Antivirus Software:** Install reputable antivirus software to detect and remove Trojan Horses.
2. **Firewall:** Use a firewall to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, blocking unauthorized access.
3. **Regular Updates:** Keep the operating system and all software up to date to patch vulnerabilities exploited by Trojans.
4. **Caution with Downloads:** Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and be cautious with email attachments.
5. **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of social engineering and the importance of exercising caution online.

By combining these measures, users can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to Trojan Horse attacks.
